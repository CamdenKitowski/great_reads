# Great Reads 
**Website:** https://great-reads-bookshelf.vercel.app/

Great Reads helps you track books you _want to read_, those you’re _currently reading_, and ones you’ve _finished_, all in one place. Each user must sign up with an email and password. Each user can search for any book using the search bar at the top of the page. After finding your desired book, you can add it to one of your bookshelves: wishlist, reading, done.

Each bookshelf displays the books for that category, and each book has a dedicated notes page.

## Architecture
The web application runs on vercel. Within the repository, the frontend and backend are in separate folders. Each folder ties to a different vercel deployment for simplisticity purposes. The web application uses node.js as the runtime and vite as the build and bundling functionality for React.js.



## How to Run
`npm run dev`
